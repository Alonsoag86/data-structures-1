# Final Assignment 2

## Due Monday 12/11 at 4:00pm

### Part One 

Finalize an interface design for a web-based, interactive visual representation for the data generated by the two sensors you were assigned. You do not need to code/develop/complete this visual representation, but the documentation for its design should be specific, clear, and able to be fully realized based on your documentation. *25% of grade*

### Part Two

Submit a URL that returns real-time JSON from a query to your Postgres database. The returned data should be appropriate for the time of the query and map directly to the elements of the interface design you specified in Part One. *75% of grade*

Your submission should consist of:  
1. the URL where the endpoint to your database is running  
2. the URL of your (well-documented!) GitHub repository for this project  
3. detailed written and visual documentation to provide context for your work, including specifics on how your endpoint data should connect to each of the elements of your final interface design 

### Your work will be assessed on:

1. The integrity of the data  
2. The integrity of the database  
3. The efficiency of the queries and page load  
4. The choices of data structures  
5. The inclusion of relevant data  
6. The coherence and organization of your code and repository  
7. The strategy for binding the data to the visual representation  
8. Reliability, scalability, maintainability, and sustainability
